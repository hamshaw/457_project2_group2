This is our project for CIS 457
We are making a home heating system, and our focus is on scalability, so that it could be used reguardless of the size of the building, including up to commercial warehouse size

Our "current research" we are improving on is a project that Grzegorz Kukla made to control his house heating, but to improve his, we are making ours P2P in order to reduce the bounds that a Client-Server puts on a system.
his project is shown here:

To get started, we utilized code on this website to better implement a simple P2P system:
